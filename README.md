## Media and Summary
![Game1](https://i.imgur.com/jGBIETu.png)
Have fun building burgers to order! In this simple game, ingredients fall from the sky! Manuever your pan to catch them in the right order.


![Game2](https://i.imgur.com/VuKVUaA.png)
Don't move your pan too quickly though! Your ingredients could go flying off!


![Game3](https://i.imgur.com/CbI2x4a.png)
Get points and additional time based on the size of the order and if they're in the correct order. Get consecutive perfect orders to rack up a score multipler!


![Game4](https://i.imgur.com/0ldTrpV.png)
On the harder difficulties, avoid nasty, rotten ingredients! They will only mess up your order!


![MainMenu](https://i.imgur.com/3ZJJN81.png)
Using the magic of the internet, compete with your friends and family in order to get a high score! Everyone can join in on the fun (granted they have a computer with an internet connection!) 


![Options](https://i.imgur.com/jQUsRPz.png)
Computer not too powerful? Laptop trackpad sending your items flying? Don't worry! We have a robust options menu with an additional "WASD Mode" that allows you to control the pan with your WASD or arrow keys instead of the mouse.
